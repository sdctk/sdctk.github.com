It's a developer friendly experience that unlocks\nthe power and flexibility to incorporate products into your site's content.\nUsing the code injection feature within Ghost, it's entirely impossible to\nintegrate with Snipcart directly and start selling products and services from\nyour site.\n\nSign up for a Snipcart account\nSnipcart offer two payment options, with 2% fees on each purchase or fixed fees.\nCheck out their pricing [https://snipcart.com/pricing]  page and sign up for\nyour Snipcart account. Alternatively, you can try out the software for free in\ntest mode.\n\nOnce you have signed up, grab your code snippet from the Snipcart dashboard\nwhich looks like this with your API key in place:\n\n<script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n\n<script src=\"https://cdn.snipcart.com/scripts/2.0/snipcart.js\" data-api-key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\" id=\"snipcart\"></script>\n\n<link href=\"https://cdn.snipcart.com/themes/2.0/base/snipcart.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\n\n\nYou'll find this information inside the API keys  area of your account:\n\nNote that your account and API key will be in test mode by default. You can use\ntest mode for free completely unlimited. To switch to live, you'll need to add a\ncredit card, and then implement Snipcart using the live API key. \n\nUse Ghost Code Injection\nIn Ghost you can inject code across your entire site or on an individual post or\npage. Snipcart requires a single piece of code to be implemented across your\nsite, so that you're able to manually add products on posts or pages as\nrequired. To do this, we'll use the global code injection feature which can be\nfound in the Ghost Admin settings menu:\n\n> Note: We're using Site Footer  instead of the Header  because the default Ghost\ntheme includes jQuery which is not visible in code injection, and must always be\nabove Snipcart's .js file.\nYour site is now fully integrated with Snipcart and you can turn any element on\nyour site into buyable products using code ðŸŽ‰\n\nUse product attributes in your site's HTML\nSince Snipcart is a sensible developer tool - once your code snippet is in place\nyou can then store products directly inside your website's HTML code. \n\nThis can be done using an HTML card inside the Ghost editor on any page or post:\n \n\nAlternatively, you can place your Snipcart code directly into your Handlebars\ntheme [https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/]  or your custom front-end\n[https://docs.ghost.org/concepts/front-end/]  if you're using Ghost as a\nHeadless CMS.\n\nHow does it work? \nAll of your product information is stored in the HTML markup. You can basically\nconvert any link or element into a buy button. Here's an example of the geek\nshirt  button from Snipcartâ€™s homepage:\n\n<button\n    class=\"snipcart-add-item\"\n    data-item-id=\"2\"\n    data-item-name=\"The Geek shirt\"\n    data-item-price=\"20.00\"\n    data-item-weight=\"20\"\n    data-item-url=\"http://myapp.com/products/geekshirt\"\n    data-item-description=\"Be the coolest geek in town with this awesome shirt\">\n    Try the cart!\n</button>\n\n\nYou can preview a Snipcart buy button in action on their homepage\n[https://www.snipcart.com/]  - when a visitor clicks the buy button it looks\nsomething like this:\n\nAllow your readers to buy products without having to leave your site!For more\ninformation about creating custom attributes, check out the Snipcart \ndocumentation [https://docs.snipcart.com/].","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"21 February, 2019","published_at_pretty":"19 November, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"26 February, 2019","created_at":"2019-02-21T10:38:30.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-11-19T11:06:00.000+00:00","updated_at":"2019-02-26T05:04:02.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Ecommerce","slug":"ecommerce","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#integration","slug":"hash-integration","visibility":"internal"}],"authors":[{"name":"Kym Ellis","slug":"kym"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c6f8f060ae79d00c081f7b7","slug":"bigcommerce","title":"BigCommerce","excerpt":"Embed your ecommerce products directly into you Ghost publication using the Buy\nButton embed integration with BigCommerce\n\nThe BigCommerce\n[https://www.bigcommerce.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_campaign=integration] \nplatform allows you to sell products online with full ecommerce functionality,\nincluding the option to embed your products anywhere on the web. \n\nUsing the BigCommerce Buy Button function, you can grab a code snippet for any\nproduct that you're selling and paste it into a card in the Gh","feature_image":"https://docs.ghost.io/content/images/2019/02/bigcommerce.png","plaintext":"Embed your ecommerce products directly into you Ghost publication using the Buy\nButton embed integration with BigCommerce\n\nThe BigCommerce\n[https://www.bigcommerce.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_campaign=integration] \nplatform allows you to sell products online with full ecommerce functionality,\nincluding the option to embed your products anywhere on the web. \n\nUsing the BigCommerce Buy Button function, you can grab a code snippet for any\nproduct that you're selling and paste it into a card in the Ghost editor.
