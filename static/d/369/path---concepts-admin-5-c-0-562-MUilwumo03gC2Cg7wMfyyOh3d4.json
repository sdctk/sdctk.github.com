Ghost-Admin is a completely independent client application to the Ghost Core API which doesn't have any impact on performance. And, writers don't need to suffer their way through learning Git just to publish a new post.</p>\n<p>Great for editors. Great for developers. Also available as <a href=\"/concepts/https://ghost.org/downloads_zh_CN\">Desktop App</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"sdc_toolkits_page/images/concepts/ghost-admin.png\" alt=\"Ghost Admin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"publishing-workflow\"><a href=\"#publishing-workflow\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Publishing workflow</h2>\n<p>Hacking together some Markdown files and throwing a static-site generator on top is nice in theory, but anyone who has tried to manage a content archive knows how quickly this falls apart under even light usage. What happens when you want to schedule a post to be published on Monday?</p>\n<p><img src=\"sdc_toolkits_page/images/concepts/publishing-workflow.png\" alt=\"Publishing Worfklow\"></p>\n<p>Great editorial teams need proper tools which help them be effective, which is why Ghost-Admin has all the standard editorial workflow features available at the click of a button. From inputting custom social and SEO data to customising exactly how and where content will be output.</p>\n<h2 id=\"best-in-class-editor\"><a href=\"#best-in-class-editor\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Best-in-class editor</h2>\n<p>Ghost Admin also comes with a world-class editor for authoring posts, which is directly tied to a rock-solid document storage format.
