While the exact roadmap isn't shared publicly (we tried it and it turned out to be more distracting than helpful), the things being worked on are generally very visible <a href=\"/sdc_toolkits_page/concepts/https:/github.com/tryghost/ghost\">on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Currently our primary focus areas largely surround:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making Ghost more flexible and easy to integrate with other apps &#x26; services</li>\n<li>Creating new, sustainable business models for publishers</li>\n<li>Refining and improving the core functionality of the product</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"feature-requests\"><a href=\"#feature-requests\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Feature requests</h2>\n<p>We welcome feature requests from users over in <a href=\"/sdc_toolkits_page/concepts/https:/forum.ghost.org/c/Ideas\">the ideas category</a> of the Ghost Forum. Here people can request and suggest things which they'd like to see in Ghost, and others can add their vote or comment. </p>\n<p>The ideas board is a great way for us to guage user demand, but it's not a democratic system. We don't automatically build things just because they get a lot of votes, and not everything that gets requested makes it into core.</p>\n<p>The best way to get a feature you want looked at quicker is to <a href=\"/sdc_toolkits_page/concepts/concepts/contributing_zh_CN\">get involved by contributing to the project</a> to help build it. That's how open source software works!</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-it-into-core\"><a href=\"#what-makes-it-into-core\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What makes it into core?</h2>\n<p>There are a million things we <em>could</em> build, but we certainly can't build all of them - nor would we want to. So how do we determine what goes where?</p>\n<p>Features which are fundamentally core to creating a managing a modern publication tend to be the things which are almost always included in core. These are the types of features without which the platform would be fundamentally less useful, or too reliant on external services for comfort.</p>\n<p>This is the area where we spend the majority of our product development time and where we believe we can create something special.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-doesnt\"><a href=\"#what-doesnt\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What doesn't?</h2>\n<p>Conversely, there are certain features which we very deliberately leave out of core.</p>\n<h3 id=\"integrations\"><a href=\"#integrations\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Integrations</h3>\n<p>For features which are so large that there are multiple entire companies and startups dedicated to doing just-that-one-thing, we most frequently build integrations rather than competing features.
